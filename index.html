                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h4>Rewriting <em>Life</em> with <em>Code</em></h4>
                <p>Mom, Grandma, Barber, and now a Full-stack Web Developer in training (quite the career jump, I know). 
                    After raising kids and cutting hair for 26 years, I decided it was time to trade my clippers for code, 
                    even though tech is totally outside my comfort zone. But that’s where the fun (and the fear) happens, right?</p>
                    <p>I’ve always been about creating connections—whether it was giving someone a fresh haircut or now, building websites. 
                    Turns out, coding has a lot in common with life: it’s messy, full of bugs, and sometimes you just have to hit refresh. 
                    When I’m not wrestling with lines of code, I’m navigating the wild, wonderful world of mothering adult kids, 
                    which is a whole new adventure in itself.</p>
                    <p>So, here I am—learning, laughing, and figuring it all out as I go.</p>
